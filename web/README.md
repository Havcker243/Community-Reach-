### Aim

"Community Reach" is designed with the purpose of bridging the gap in communication and fostering social interactions within communities, businesses, and schools. While its inception focused on smaller communities, its overarching goal is to combat feelings of isolation and the challenges people face in meeting new individuals or communicating with peers. The platform aims to:

1. Alleviate the "imposter syndrome" many individuals experience.
2. Facilitate easy and approachable ways for people to step out and connect with others.
3. Serve as a primary source for community events and gatherings.

### Function

The website operates as a centralized hub for community event information. Its core functions include:

1. Providing a comprehensive list of events happening within a user's community.
2. Allowing users to host or promote their events to gain more visibility.
3. Offering a search function to identify events based on location or interest.

### Description

The website consists of five key pages:

1. **Home Page**: The landing page presenting a brief overview of the platform and its features.
2. **Host an Event Page**: A form page where users can add details about their event, including time, date, and location.
3. **Location Finder**: A dual-function page. Users can input a location to discover upcoming events. Clicking on a particular event will open a Google Maps direction to the event.
4. **Events Page**: Highlights major community events, ensuring users are always informed about significant happenings around them.
5. **Mood-based Events**: Suggests events based on a user's current mood, ensuring personalized event suggestions.

### Progress

1. Currently working on the host event page and find the event page
2. Connecting the website to a database to handle and store events 
3. Currently enhancing visuals, ensuring compatibility across phones, laptops, and iPads.
4. Transitioning the codebase to React for more dynamic interactions
5. Expanding the platform with additional pages

### Future Plans

1. Integrate a Map API to enhance the Location Finder page.
2. Develop additional webpages to cater to broader user needs.
3. Optimize the website's responsiveness for seamless browsing on all devices.
